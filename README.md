## A little bit about me 👁👃👁: 
* I am a student at **_the University of Texas at Austin_**, Class of 2023 🧡.
* **Major**: _B.S, Psychology_.
* **Certificate**: _Pre-Health_ ⛑ and _Forensics Science_ 🔬 Certificates.
* **Fun Facts**: I love watching superheroes movies ([X-Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_First_Class) 🧬 is my favorite so far). 
* I like studying Psychology and working with data. At first, my interest in data science was ignited from working in a project for my Statistic Class. Then, I received an valuable opportunites to work as Data Science Intern, provided by Psychology Department at UT. It was the moment that hooked me into this field even more.
