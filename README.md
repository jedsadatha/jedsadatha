## Hello! ##
*Welcome!* to my GitHub. I am Jedsada Thavornfung (Jay). I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, class of 2023, with B.S. Psychology along with _Pre-Health_ and _Forensics Science_ Certificates. I'm an incoming MS-HCI student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm passionate about merging science and art, with a keen interest in research, data visualization, and graphic design. I strive to create clear and impactful work that simplifies complex ideas, making them accessible and easily understood by all audiences.
