### Hello!

My name is **_Jedsada Thavornfung_**. I am currently majoring in *_B.S, Psychology_* at the University of Texas at Austin ðŸ¤˜. Along with my degree, I am also pursuing _Pre-Heath and Forensics Science Certificates_. I am interested in Psychology and Data Science. Thus, I am trying to merge both of my interested together.
